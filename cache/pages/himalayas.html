How appropriate that I'm writing this happy news now.  Not only are we all soaking in the beauty of Spring, but 17 March 2005 was when the idea for <em>Himalayas</em> was born (unending thanks to Jim Felton).</p>
<p><em>The Patron Saint of the Himalayas</em> is now available in print and as an e-book*.</p>

<p>Please spread this happy news around ...It was a gift to write and I'm thrilled to finally be sharing it with the world (or rather, with the English-speaking part of the world ...smile).</p>
<p>From the beginning, the creation of <em>Himalayas</em> has been an amazing journey.  I'm giddy with excitement as I sit here looking at the printed proof.  I'm grateful to Jorge V. for putting the bug in my ear about self-publishing.  I'm also grateful to Bryan ...for infinite things, but in this instance, for loving me through the process of turning this story into a book ...and for the cover art.</p>
<p>I know that nothing is ever done "alone" and thank every single person in my life who, any time over the past 7 years (I'm laughing now ...and if you read the book, you'll get why the fact that it's taken 7 years to get here is so totally perfect) has participated in some way to process of breathing this book into being.</p>
<p>I look forward to hearing your feedback. Amazon/CreateSpace (same-same) has a great preview/review form <a title="Himalayas Preview on CreateSpace" href="https://www.createspace.com/Preview/1098568" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p><em>e-book version currently not available for Apple, Sony or Kobo products. Please let me know if you would like to purchase <em>Himalayas</em> for one of these products.

I've decided to self-publish <strong>The Patron Saint of the Himalayas</strong> (huge thanks to Bryan and Jorge Vismara).</p>
<p>The book is done.  I'm simply waiting for permission to print song lyrics.  Once that's clear, I'll post a link on how to find the printed book.</p>
<p>Again, stay tuned.</body></html></p>
